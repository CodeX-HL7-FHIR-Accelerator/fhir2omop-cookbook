# fhir2omop-cookbook
The FHIR-to-OMOP Cookbook is starter guide for implementers seeking to convert HL7 FHIR resources to the OMOP CDM.  The Cookbook compares the purpose, design principles of both FHIR and OMOP CDM. It proposes a methodology for mapping with example use cases and patterns in mapping FHIR resources to equivalent OMOP CDM elements.

The cookbook is currently a work in progress and will evolve over time to incorporate new insights and community feedback. We encourage readers to contribute to future versions of the cookbook in several ways:
* Contacting the authors by email listed in the Contact Information section of this document.
* By entering in issues via our Github FHIR to OMOP Cookbook repository: https://github.com/CodeX-HL7-FHIR-Accelerator/fhir2omop-cookbook/issues
* Configuring Github notifications for new updates to the Cookbook.
